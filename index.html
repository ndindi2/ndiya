  <h2>BACKGROUND OF SAUSAGE</h2>
  <h3> #LITLE </h3>
<p><article>The manufacture of sausages began over two thousand years ago, and it is still a growing industry. While some of its basic practices are almost as old as civilisation, the industry is constantly adopting new developments in processing in the light of later scientific and technical knowledge.

Sausage has been an important item in man's diet for twenty centuries. The first recognisable mention of this meat food is found in a Greek play called "The Orya," or "The Sausage," written about 500 B.C. Thereafter the word for sausage occurs with frequency in Greek writings. </article></p>

   <h2>ADVANTAGES OF SAUSAGE</h2>
   <h3> #KNOWLEDGE</h3>
  <p>Meat is fine in moderation – it's a good source of some nutrients such as protein, iron and zinc. It's just about being sensible, and not eating too much, too often." So: eat more fruit and veg, less red and processed meat, get plenty of fibre and try not to consume too much salt.</p>
  <p>Pork sausage may get a bad rap in our society of all natural, healthy and green eaters, but it's not all bad. Typically pork sausage is higher in fat (around twice as much) than turkey and chicken sausage, but this doesn't mean that you shouldn't eat it.</p>

  <h2> DISADVANTAGE OF SAUSAGE</h2>
  <h3> #IS DANGEROUS</h3>
<p>They are not restricted to processed meat, but significant amounts can be found in sausages, fried bacon and meat burgers (31).</p>

 <p>HCAs cause cancer when given to animals in high amounts. Generally speaking, these amounts are much higher than those normally found in the human diet (32).Jun 4, 2017hgyfyihhydygjgftgijgfyojhhgj-op]</p><p>[po0-i08u978uijkl</p><p>kijohygtfugioij[pllpopijuyt67r6yoijk[pl]kbinugoikkyhkljhgiujm,

<P1>1. Kielbasa “Kiełbasa” is the Polish word for sausage and in Poland it can mean any kind of sausage. In the U.S., kielbasa (also known simply as “Polish sausage”) refers to a horseshoe-shaped, pork country sausage that is most often smoked, but is sometimes partially smoked or unsmoked. Whatever kind you’re using, you’ll want to heat it because it tastes best that way. Partly smoked or unsmoked kielbasa will have to be cooked through. 2. Andouille Andouille is a spicy smoked sausage originally from France, but known mainly for its role in Cajun cuisine, where it is a key ingredient in jambalaya and gumbo. You can also use it in any recipe that calls for smoked sausage if you want a little heat. 3. Bratwurst Bratwurst comes to us from Germany, where there are more than a dozen varieties. In the U.S., however, it’s typically made of pork and veal, and seasoned with salt, ginger, nutmeg and caraway. 4. Italian Sausage Italian sausage comes in two varieties — hot and sweet. Hot sausage is typically made from pork and seasoned with salt, garlic, anise seed and red pepper flakes. Sweet sausage omits the pepper flakes but is otherwise the same. These types of sausage are interchangeable; it just depends on your spice preference. 5. Chorizo In the U.S., chorizo usually refers to the Mexican variety, which is uncured and flavored with chilies, garlic and spices, although the exact ingredients can vary. Most often sold in casings, chorizo is generally removed from them and cooked prior to use. Simply sauté it as you would ground beef and use it in enchiladas, tacos, burritos, soups or stews.</P1>
